8,1,1,Sport,South Africa vs Namibia, SuperSport 1,22-Sep-11,9:00,,Namibia faces a tough task as they take on the defending champions at North Harbour.,"Springbok coach Peter de Villiers has stuck to the policy of treating every match as a final but he has still found space to keep fringe players sharp in his selection for the third World Cup match against Namibia in North Harbour. 

De Villiers has made five changes to the side that smashed Fiji 49-3 last Saturday, with two new wings being given an opportunity to build confidence against South Africa’s immediate neighbours. Bryan Habana returns from injury on the left wing and Gio Aplon gets his first start of the tournament ahead of JP Pietersen. 

Pietersen and Odwa Ndungane have both been rested altogether, as has tighthead prop Jannie du Plessis, who makes way for CJ van der Linde, the man who propped the scrum in the last World Cup final with Os du Randt. 

Two other stalwarts, Heinrich Brussow and Fourie du Preez, have been dropped to the bench, with the reasoning there being the need to give reserve loose-forward Willem Alberts and reserve scrumhalf Francois Hougaard an opportunity to start in what should be a low key game ahead of the tougher obstacles that lie ahead. 

The need to manage players by balancing the need for fringe players to be sharp and frontline players refreshed has also seen Bismarck du Plessis off the bench. Chiliboy Ralepelle, who had not been part of the match day squad at the World Cup as yet, will play off the bench and hopefully get enough playing time to enable him to be ready if injury to skipper John Smit or Du Plessis means he gets to play in the knock-outs. 

There were four players unavailable for selection – locks Victor Matfield and Johann Muller, flyhalf Butch James and centre Jean de Villiers. The coach has opted to continue with the Frans Steyn/Jaque Fourie midfield combination that was so excellent against Fiji. 

Although there has been a hint of mixing and matching, the team remains the basic unit that hammered Fiji, and it is a strong one. If there is any incongruity anywhere it is in the back row, where Willem Alberts has been named on the flank. In the team announcement Alberts was listed as a No6 and Schalk Burger as a No7, but it is likely that Burger will assume the role of fetcher in this match. 

“The biggest challenge is to manage our players,” said De Villiers. 

“There have been a couple of bruising encounters and a lot of our players are feeling the effects of those. Our skipper John Smit is one of those who is still standing. We want to have 30 players fit when we reach the knock-outs, and that is what we are working towards. 

“We are getting a bit thin in some areas, and we want to have the guarantee that back-up players are ready to play if they are needed. Injuries have been the biggest part of our stay here so far. So we are using this as an opportunity to see what Willem brings when he starts.” 

Patrick Lambie is over the slight wrist strain that kept him from training on Monday and will continue at fullback, where he is likely to help create an opportunity for the recalled Habana to score the try that he needs to eclipse Joost van der Westhuizen’s try-scoring record for the Springboks. However De Villiers made it clear this would not be a focus. 

“I am not sure everyone understands our team and our focus. No player in this team plays for his individual goals, it is all about team goals and what you can do for the team. If there was a player who had a different attitude we would put him on a plane home,” said De Villiers. 

Skipper Smit said that the focus was squarely on Namibia and that the team had not been deflected by the probability that they would now be facing Australia in the quarterfinal round. 

“There are so many different permutations that we have taken the attitude that you have to just focus on the next opponents and take each week as it comes. That is the only way you can win a seven week tournament,” said Smit. 

The probability that a knock-out against Australia is now only 160 minutes ago is sure however to add urgency to the Springbok drive to accelerate the process of improving, something that Smit believes has been happening steadily since the home leg of the Tri-Nations. 

Springbok team:
15-Pat Lambie, 14-Gio Aplon, 13-Jaque Fourie, 12-Frans Steyn, 11-Bryan Habana, 10-Morne Steyn, 9-Francois Hougaard; 8-Pierre Spies, 7-Schalk Burger, 6-Willem Alberts, 5-Danie Rossouw, 4-Bakkies Botha, 3-CJ Van der Linde, 2-John Smit (captain), 1-Gurthro Steenkamp. 

Replacements - 16-Chiliboy Ralepelle, 17-Tendai Mtawarira, 18-Francois Louw, 19-Heinrich Brussow, 20-Fourie du Preez, 21-Ruan Pienaar, 22-Juan de Jongh.

9,1,1,Sport,Liverpool vs Brighton, SuperSport 3,21-Sep-11,20:30,,Liverpool gears up for Carling Cup third round encounter with Brighton.,"Steven Gerrard is poised to make his long-awaited comeback as Liverpool look to forget their Premier League problems by beating Brighton in their third round League Cup clash on Wednesday (21 September).

Gerrard has not played since suffering a groin problem in March which required surgery, but manager Kenny Dalglish is set to use the game to ease his influential captain back into action after six months on the sidelines. 

Two successive league defeats, including a 4-0 hammering at Tottenham on Sunday, have marred Liverpool's solid start to the season, but the return of the England midfielder will lift spirits. 

""I've said all along, he's done fantastically well to get where he is,"" said Dalglish when asked about the imminent return of Gerrard. 

""We'll just monitor him and pick the right moment for him and us before we get him back. It's natural everyone wants to chase Stevie, especially after you have lost 4-0. 

""But we'll monitor it, take it how it goes and when both parties agree he'll play."" 
Gerrard has not been seen in action since helping Liverpool defeat Manchester United 3-1 at Anfield on March 6. 

He resumed full training two weeks ago and emerged unscathed after taking part in a practice match last week. 

""Now I'm back in with the boys, it's a completely different ball game -it's a lot tougher, quicker and I've struggled the last two days, so I'm really tired at the moment,"" said Gerrard earlier this month. 

""But I'm back in full training and looking forward to being involved with the lads in games in the coming weeks."" 

Teenagers Danny Wilson, John Flanagan and Jack Robinson are also expected to feature in a much-changed side from the one on duty at White Hart Lane, where Liverpool finished with nine men after Charlie Adam and Martin Skrtel were sent off. 

Both players will be suspended for the trip to the south coast as a result. 
Brighton are currently third in the Championship after being promoted from the third tier last season, and manager Gus Poyet is confident his players can give a good account of themselves during a hectic 48 hours which also sees Brighton entertain Leeds on Friday. 

""I need to manage the squad and the team the right way, to have a decent team against Liverpool and a very, very good team against Leeds on Friday but it's going to be tough,"" said Poyet. 

Full-back Marcos Painter will miss the tie through suspension following his sending off for two bookable offences during the 1-0 defeat to Leicester last Saturday.",,,,,,
10,1,1,Sport,Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Warriors, SuperSport 2,23-Sep-11,16:00,,The Champions League Twenty20 blasts off with a cracking game between two talented sides.,"Eastern Cape based Chevrolet Warriors will be flying the South African flag in the third edition of the Champions League Twenty20. Their task will not be an easy one as they will be against the Royal Challengers Bangalore who finished behind Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League.

The Warriors who reached the final of last year’s competition will be looking to their captain Davey Jacobs for leadership and the skipper  who played for the Mumbai Indians in IPL will want to use the experience of opening the batting with Indian great Sachin Tendulkar to pile on the runs for his franchise. With a strong squad mixed with experience and youth the Warriors will fancy their chances against a well-balanced Royal Challengers Bangalore side.

The talented Royal Challengers Bangalore squad consists an array of superstars like All-rounder Tillakaratne Dilshan, batsman AB de Villiers and  Zaheer Khan who had the privilege of being named in ICC’s ODI team of the year at the ICC Awards ceremony held in London. Also in the squad is exiled Western Indian opening batsmen Chris Gayle who was instrumental in the Challengers success in the IPL. Making the opening game of the Champions League Twenty20 a must see for all cricket fans.

11,1,1,Sport,New Zealand vs France, SuperSport 1,24-Sep-11,10:15,,The ballparks are on fire in September…,"New Zealand media blasted France's team as an ""insult"" and a ""farce"" on Wednesday (21 September) claiming they had chosen an experimental line-up to face the mighty All Blacks. 

Rugby writers accused France of picking a weaker team because the loser of Saturday's (24 September) game in Auckland is likely to face an easier route through the knock-out stages. 

""It is an insult to the 60 000 who have bought tickets expecting a contest between teams at full strength,"" fumed rugby journalist Peter Bills, in a column in the New Zealand Herald. 

""France have devalued the most eagerly awaited World Cup game for four years and blown an enormous raspberry at the IRB (International Rugby Board),"" wrote Bills. 

""France have made so many bizarre selections for this weekend that the conspiracy theory is the only logical explanation,"" he added. 

The match is loaded with historical significance after France shocked the All Blacks in the quarterfinals four years ago, reviving memories of their famous 1999 semi when Les Bleus came storming back from behind to win 43-31. 
French coach Marc Lievremont named scrumhalf Morgan Parra at flyhalf, left usual No 8 Inamol Harinordoquy on the bench, while giving Dimitri Szarzewski his first start of the competition at hooker. 

The French camp have hotly denied any suggestions that they are sending out an understrength team and insist they are bent on once again defeating the All Blacks. 

The top team in Pool A will face likely knock-out games against Argentina and either South Africa or Australia to reach the final, while the runner-up looks set to play England and then Ireland or Wales. ",,,,,,
